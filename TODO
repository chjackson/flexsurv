document return value for summary fn: vector of length t?

error if using pmatrix.fs with a SMM

quantiles at 0 and 1 are min and max: use in flexsurvspline   

Make sure all features have tests


OPTIONAL

make plot/summary do baseline values of factor covs and mean of continuous

Generic (restricted) mean of distributions, integration if necessary

inits and fixedpars named

anova / LR test method, like anova.survreg, anova.survreglist, using
   stats::stat.anova
could loglik component simply be used for these

cluster standard errors as in survreg

plot two groups for a numeric 0/1 variable

hHsurvspline: vectorise as dp

intervals in Surv are open on left, closed on right

other types of status: mstate

CIs as grey bands not lines
