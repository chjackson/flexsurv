Ongoing problems with Hessian in Weibull models (see p metcalfe example)

SURVREG

does 1/2 Surv indicator work, and TRUE/FALSE?  if so is n events reported correctly



OPTIONAL

document and test PH weibull. does it need dpq as well as hHr? 

make plot/summary do baseline values of factor covs and mean of continuous

Delta method for survival - a lot of distribution-specific faff.

Generic (restricted) mean of distributions, integration if necessary

inits and fixedpars named

anova / LR test method, like anova.survreg, anova.survreglist, using
   stats::stat.anova
could loglik component simply be used for these

cluster standard errors as in survreg

plot two groups for a numeric 0/1 variable

hHsurvspline: vectorise as dp

intervals in Surv are open on left, closed on right

other types of status: mstate

CIs as grey bands not lines

#are these buggy in survreg::Surv?
#time <- ifelse(time == Inf, NA, time)
#time2 <- ifelse(time2 == -Inf, NA, time2)

Migrate doc to roxygen?

Newton-Raphson (analytic second derivs) available in maxLik::maxNR

allow time-dependent covs to influence the hazard in pmatrix.fs
