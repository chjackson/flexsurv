\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula expression in conventional R linear modelling
  syntax. The response must be a survival object as returned by the
  \code{\link[survival]{Surv}} function, and any covariates are given on the
  right-hand side.  For example,

  \code{Surv(time, dead) ~ age + sex}

  \code{Surv} objects of \code{type="right"},\code{"counting"},
  \code{"interval1"} or \code{"interval2"} are supported, corresponding to
  right-censored, left-truncated or interval-censored observations.

  If there are no covariates, specify \code{1} on the right hand side, for
  example \code{Surv(time, dead) ~ 1}.

  If the right hand side is specified as \code{.} all remaining variables are
  included as covariates. For example, \code{Surv(time, dead) ~ .}
  corresponds to \code{Surv(time, dead) ~ age + sex} if \code{data} contains
  the variables \code{time}, \code{dead}, \code{age}, and \code{sex}.

  By default, covariates are placed on the ``location'' parameter of the
  distribution, typically the "scale" or "rate" parameter, through a linear
  model, or a log-linear model if this parameter must be positive.  This
  gives an accelerated failure time model or a proportional hazards model
  (see \code{dist} below) depending on how the distribution is
  parameterised.

  Covariates can be placed on other (``ancillary'') parameters by using the
  name of the parameter as a ``function'' in the formula.  For example, in a
  Weibull model, the following expresses the scale parameter in terms of age
  and a treatment variable \code{treat}, and the shape parameter in terms of
  sex and treatment.

  \code{Surv(time, dead) ~ age + treat + shape(sex) + shape(treat)}

  However, if the names of the ancillary parameters clash with any real
  functions that might be used in formulae (such as \code{I()}, or
  \code{factor()}), then those functions will not work in the formula.  A
  safer way to model covariates on ancillary parameters is through the
  \code{anc} argument to \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}.

  \code{\link[survival]{survreg}} users should also note that the function
  \code{strata()} is ignored, so that any covariates surrounded by
  \code{strata()} are applied to the location parameter.  Likewise the
  function \code{frailty()} is not handled.}

\item{anc}{An alternative and safer way to model covariates on ancillary
  parameters, that is, parameters other than the main location parameter of
  the distribution.  This is a named list of formulae, with the name of each
  component giving the parameter to be modelled.  The model above can also
  be defined as:

  \code{Surv(time, dead) ~ age + treat, anc = list(shape = ~ sex +
  treat)}}

\item{data}{A data frame in which to find variables supplied in
\code{formula}.  If not given, the variables should be in the
working environment.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric variable giving weights for each
individual in the data.  The fitted model is then defined by
maximising the weighted sum of the individual-specific
log-likelihoods.  The \code{res} and \code{res.t} component of
the model object will then also include a "robust" standard
error defined by a sandwich estimator (see, e.g. Lin and Wei,
JASA (1989) 84(408): 1074â€“1078).}

\item{bhazard}{Optional variable giving expected hazards for relative
  survival models.  The model is described by Nelson et al. (2007).

  \code{bhazard} should contain a vector of values for each person in
  the data.

 \itemize{
 \item  For people with observed events, \code{bhazard} refers to the
  hazard at the observed event time.

 \item  For people whose event time is
  left-censored or interval-censored, \code{bhazard} should contain the
  probability of dying by the end of the corresponding interval,
  conditionally on being alive at the start.

  \item For people whose event time
  is right-censored, the value of \code{bhazard} is ignored and does not
  need to be specified.
}

  If \code{bhazard} is supplied, then the parameter estimates returned by
  \code{flexsurvreg} and the outputs returned by \code{summary.flexsurvreg}
  describe the parametric model for relative survival.
  
  For relative survival models, the log-likelihood returned by \code{flexsurvreg} is a partial
  log-likelihood, which omits a constant term defined by the sum of the
  cumulative hazards at the event or censoring time for each individual.   
  Hence this constant must be added if a full likelihood is needed.}

\item{rtrunc}{Optional variable giving individual-specific right-truncation
  times.  Used for analysing data with "retrospective ascertainment".  For
  example, suppose we want to estimate the distribution of the time from
  onset of a disease to death, but have only observed cases known to have
  died by the current date.   In this case, times from onset to death for
  individuals in the data are right-truncated by the current date minus the
  onset date.   Predicted survival times for new cases can then be described
  by an un-truncated version of the fitted distribution.

  These models can suffer from weakly identifiable parameters and
  badly-behaved likelihood functions, and it is advised to compare
  convergence for different initial values by supplying different
  \code{inits} arguments to \code{flexsurvreg}.}

\item{subset}{Vector of integers or logicals specifying the subset of the
observations to be used in the fit.}

\item{na.action}{a missing-data filter function, applied after any 'subset'
argument has been used. Default is \code{options()$na.action}.}

\item{dist}{Typically, one of the strings in the first column of the
  following table, identifying a built-in distribution.  This table also
  identifies the location parameters, and whether covariates on these
  parameters represent a proportional hazards (PH) or accelerated failure
  time (AFT) model.  In an accelerated failure time model, the covariate
  speeds up or slows down the passage of time.  So if the coefficient
  (presented on the log scale) is log(2), then doubling the covariate value
  would give half the expected survival time.

  \code{"exponential"} and \code{"lognormal"} can be used as aliases for
  \code{"exp"} and \code{"lnorm"}, for compatibility with
  \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}.

  Alternatively, \code{dist} can be a list specifying a custom distribution.
  See section ``Custom distributions'' below for how to construct this list.

  Very flexible spline-based distributions can also be fitted with
  \code{\link{flexsurvspline}}.

  The parameterisations of the built-in distributions used here are the same
  as in their built-in distribution functions: \code{\link{dgengamma}},
  \code{\link{dgengamma.orig}}, \code{\link{dgenf}},
  \code{\link{dgenf.orig}}, \code{\link{dweibull}}, \code{\link{dgamma}},
  \code{\link{dexp}}, \code{\link{dlnorm}}, \code{\link{dgompertz}},
  respectively.  The functions in base R are used where available,
  otherwise, they are provided in this package.

  A package vignette "Distributions reference" lists the survivor functions
  and covariate effect parameterisations used by each built-in distribution.

  For the Weibull, exponential and log-normal distributions,
  \code{\link{flexsurvreg}} simply works by calling \code{\link[survival]{survreg}} to
  obtain the maximum likelihood estimates, then calling \code{\link{optim}}
  to double-check convergence and obtain the covariance matrix for
  \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}'s preferred parameterisation.

  The Weibull parameterisation is different from that in
  \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}, instead it is consistent with
  \code{\link{dweibull}}.  The \code{"scale"} reported by
  \code{\link[survival]{survreg}} is equivalent to \code{1/shape} as defined
  by \code{\link{dweibull}} and hence \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}.  The first
  coefficient \code{(Intercept)} reported by \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}
  is equivalent to \code{log(scale)} in \code{\link{dweibull}} and
  \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}.

  Similarly in the exponential distribution, the rate, rather than the mean,
  is modelled on covariates.

  The object \code{flexsurv.dists} lists the names of the built-in
  distributions, their parameters, location parameter, functions used to
  transform the parameter ranges to and from the real line, and the
  functions used to generate initial values of each parameter for
  estimation.}

\item{inits}{An optional numeric vector giving initial values for each
  unknown parameter.  These are numbered in the order: baseline parameters
  (in the order they appear in the distribution function, e.g. shape before
  scale in the Weibull), covariate effects on the location parameter,
  covariate effects on the remaining parameters.  This is the same order as
  the printed estimates in the fitted model.

  If not specified, default initial values are chosen from a simple summary
  of the survival or censoring times, for example the mean is often used to
  initialize scale parameters.  See the object \code{flexsurv.dists} for the
  exact methods used.  If the likelihood surface may be uneven, it is
  advised to run the optimisation starting from various different initial
  values to ensure convergence to the true global maximum.}

\item{fixedpars}{Vector of indices of parameters whose values will be fixed
at their initial values during the optimisation.  The indices are ordered
as in \code{inits}.  For example, in a stable generalized Gamma model with
two covariates, to fix the third of three generalized gamma parameters
(the shape \code{Q}, see the help for \code{\link{GenGamma}}) and the
second covariate, specify \code{fixedpars = c(3, 5)}}

\item{dfns}{An alternative way to define a custom survival distribution (see
  section ``Custom distributions'' below).  A list whose components may
  include \code{"d"}, \code{"p"}, \code{"h"}, or \code{"H"} containing the
  probability density, cumulative distribution, hazard, or cumulative hazard
  functions of the distribution.  For example,

  \code{list(d=dllogis, p=pllogis)}.

  If \code{dfns} is used, a custom \code{dlist} must still be provided, but
  \code{dllogis} and \code{pllogis} need not be visible from the global
  environment.  This is useful if \code{flexsurvreg} is called within other
  functions or environments where the distribution functions are also
  defined dynamically.}

\item{aux}{A named list of other arguments to pass to custom distribution
functions.  This is used, for example, by \code{\link{flexsurvspline}} to
supply the knot locations and modelling scale (e.g. hazard or odds).  This
cannot be used to fix parameters of a distribution --- use
\code{fixedpars} for that.}

\item{cl}{Width of symmetric confidence intervals for maximum likelihood
estimates, by default 0.95.}

\item{integ.opts}{List of named arguments to pass to
  \code{\link{integrate}}, if a custom density or hazard is provided without
  its cumulative version.  For example,

  \code{integ.opts = list(rel.tol=1e-12)}}

\item{sr.control}{For the models which use \code{\link[survival]{survreg}} to find the
maximum likelihood estimates (Weibull, exponential, log-normal), this list
is passed as the \code{control} argument to \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}.}

\item{hessian}{Calculate the covariances and confidence intervals for the
parameters. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{hess.control}{List of options to control covariance matrix computation. 
   Available options are:

  \code{numeric}.  If \code{TRUE} then numerical methods are used
  to compute the Hessian for models where an analytic Hessian is
  available.  These models include the Weibull (both versions),
  exponential, Gompertz and spline models with hazard or odds
  scale.  The default is to use the analytic Hessian for these
  models.  For all other models, numerical methods are always used
  to compute the Hessian, whether or not this option is set.

  \code{tol.solve}. The tolerance used for \code{\link{solve}}
  when inverting the Hessian (default \code{.Machine$double.eps})

  \code{tol.evalues} The accepted tolerance for negative
  eigenvalues in the covariance matrix (default \code{1e-05}).

  The Hessian is positive definite, thus invertible, at the maximum
  likelihood.  If the Hessian computed after optimisation convergence can't
  be inverted, this is either because the converged result is not the
  maximum likelihood (e.g. it could be a "saddle point"), or because the
  numerical methods used to obtain the Hessian were inaccurate. If you
  suspect that the Hessian was computed wrongly enough that it is not
  invertible, but not wrongly enough that the nearest valid inverse would be
  an inaccurate estimate of the covariance matrix, then these tolerance
  values can be modified (reducing \code{tol.solve} or increasing
  \code{tol.evalues}) to allow the inverse to be computed.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments to the general-purpose optimisation routine
\code{\link{optim}}.  For example, the BFGS optimisation algorithm is the
default in \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}, but this can be changed, for example
to \code{method="Nelder-Mead"} which can be more robust to poor initial
values.  If the optimisation fails to converge, consider normalising the
problem using, for example, \code{control=list(fnscale = 2500)}, for
example, replacing 2500 by a number of the order of magnitude of the
likelihood. If 'false' convergence is reported with a
non-positive-definite Hessian, then consider tightening the tolerance
criteria for convergence. If the optimisation takes a long time,
intermediate steps can be printed using the \code{trace} argument of the
control list. See \code{\link{optim}} for details.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"flexsurvreg"} containing information about
  the fitted model.  Components of interest to users may include:

\item{call}{A copy of the function call, for use in post-processing.}

\item{dlist}{List defining the survival distribution used.}

  \item{res}{Matrix of maximum likelihood estimates and confidence limits,
  with parameters on their natural scales.

  Note the standard error \code{se} on the natural scale is determined from the standard error
  on the real scale (in component \code{res.t}) using the delta method,
  which will be inaccurate if the estimate is not roughly normally distributed on
  either scale.  The confidence interval on the natural scale is simply obtained by transforming
  the limits on the real scale, which is much more reliable. 
}

\item{res.t}{Matrix of maximum
  likelihood estimates and confidence limits, with parameters all
  transformed to the real line (using a log transform for all built-in
  models where this is necessary).  The

  this scale.

  \item{loglik}{Log-likelihood. This will differ from Stata, where the sum
  of the log uncensored survival times is added to the log-likelihood in
  survival models, to remove dependency on the time scale.

\description{
Parametric modelling or regression for time-to-event data.  Several built-in
distributions are available, and users may supply their own.
}
\details{
Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood using the algorithms
available in the standard R \code{\link{optim}} function.  Parameters
defined to be positive are estimated on the log scale.  Confidence intervals
are estimated from the Hessian at the maximum, and transformed back to the
original scale of the parameters.

The usage of \code{\link{flexsurvreg}} is intended to be similar to
\code{\link[survival]{survreg}} in the \pkg{survival} package.
}
\section{Custom distributions}{
 \code{\link{flexsurvreg}} is intended to be
  easy to extend to handle new distributions.  To define a new distribution
  for use in \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}, construct a list with the following
  elements:

  \describe{ \item{\code{"name"}}{A string naming the distribution.  If this
  is called \code{"dist"}, for example, then there must be visible in the
  working environment, at least, either

  a) a function called \code{ddist} which defines the probability density,

  or

  b) a function called \code{hdist} which defines the hazard.

  Ideally, in case a) there should also be a function called \code{pdist}
  which defines the probability distribution or cumulative density, and in
  case b) there should be a function called \code{Hdist} defining the
  cumulative hazard.  If these additional functions are not provided,
  \pkg{flexsurv} attempts to automatically create them by numerically
  integrating the density or hazard function.  However, model fitting will
  be much slower, or may not even work at all, if the analytic versions of
  these functions are not available.

  The functions must accept vector arguments (representing different times,
  or alternative values for each parameter) and return the results as a
  vector.  The function \code{\link{Vectorize}} may be helpful for doing
  this: see the example below.
These functions may be in an add-on package (see below for an example) or
may be user-written.  If they are user-written they must be defined in the
global environment, or supplied explicitly through the \code{dfns} argument
to \code{flexsurvreg}.  The latter may be useful if the functions are
created dynamically (as in the source of \code{flexsurvspline}) and thus
not visible through R's scoping rules.

Arguments other than parameters must be named in the conventional way --
for example \code{x} for the first argument of the density function or
hazard, as in \code{\link{dnorm}(x, ...)} and \code{q} for the first
argument of the probability function.  Density functions should also have
an argument \code{log}, after the parameters, which when \code{TRUE},
computes the log density, using a numerically stable additive formula if
possible.

Additional functions with names beginning with \code{"DLd"} and
\code{"DLS"} may be defined to calculate the derivatives of the log density
and log survival probability, with respect to the parameters of the
distribution.  The parameters are expressed on the real line, for example
after log transformation if they are defined as positive.  The first
argument must be named \code{t}, representing the time, and the remaining
arguments must be named as the parameters of the density function. The
function must return a matrix with rows corresponding to times, and columns
corresponding to the parameters of the distribution.  The derivatives are
used, if available, to speed up the model fitting with \code{\link{optim}}.
} \item{\code{"pars"}}{Vector of strings naming the parameters of the
distribution. These must be the same names as the arguments of the density
and probability functions.  }
\item{\code{"location"}}{Name of the main parameter governing the mean of
the distribution.  This is the default parameter on which covariates are
placed in the \code{formula} supplied to \code{flexsurvreg}. }
\item{\code{"transforms"}}{List of R
functions which transform the range of values taken by each parameter onto
the real line.  For example, \code{c(log, log)} for a distribution with two
positive parameters. }
\item{\code{"inv.transforms"}}{List of R functions defining the
corresponding inverse transformations.  Note these must be lists, even for
single parameter distributions they should be supplied as, e.g.
\code{c(exp)} or \code{list(exp)}. }
\item{\code{"inits"}}{A function of the
observed survival times \code{t} (including right-censoring times, and
using the halfway point for interval-censored times) which returns a vector
of reasonable initial values for maximum likelihood estimation of each
parameter.  For example, \code{function(t){ c(1, mean(t)) }} will always
initialize the first of two parameters at 1, and the second (a scale
parameter, for instance) at the mean of \code{t}.  } }

For example, suppose we want to use an extreme value survival distribution.
This is available in the CRAN package \pkg{eha}, which provides
conventionally-defined density and probability functions called
\code{\link[eha:EV]{eha::dEV}} and \code{\link[eha:EV]{eha::pEV}}.  See the Examples below
for the custom list in this case, and the subsequent command to fit the
model.
