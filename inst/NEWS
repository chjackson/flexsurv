Version 0.4 (2014-08-19)
-----------

* New package vignettes: a user guide and a vignette of examples.

Spline models and ancillary covariates:

* Major rewrite of flexsurvspline.  This now works by calling
  flexsurvreg with a custom distribution written dynamically.  Models
  can now include covariate effects that vary as spline functions of
  time, by including covariates on "gamma1" or on any further
  parameters.

* New argument "anc" to flexsurvreg, as an alternative and preferred
  way of modelling covariates on ancillary parameters.

* New general utility "unroll.function" which converts a function with
  matrix arguments to the equivalent function with vector arguments.
  The new flexsurvspline works by unrolling "dsurvspline".

* Quantile, random number, hazard and cumulative hazard functions for
  spline distribution.

* Autogeneration of initial values for flexsurvspline now accounts for
  left-truncation. Thanks to Ana Borges for the report.

Other new modelling features:

* Several utilities for parametric multi-state modelling, including
  transition probabilities and simulation ("pmatrix.fs",
  "pmatrix.simfs", "sim.fmsm").  An "msfit.flexsurvreg" method also
  gives cumulative incidences in the format of the "mstate" package.

* Interval censoring supported in the Surv() response.

* Relative survival models, using the "bhazard" argument to
  flexsurvreg to specify the expected mortality rate.

* flexsurvreg now uses survreg to fit Weibull, exponential and
  log-normal models, unless there is left-truncation.

Custom distributions:

* Custom distributions can be defined through the hazard function.
  This can be optionally supplemented with the cumulative hazard
  function, otherwise this is obtained by numerical integration.

* In custom distributions specified by the density, the cumulative
  distribution can now be omitted, and it will be calculated by
  numerical integration.

* New arguments "dfns" and "aux" to flexsurvreg, which can be used to
  supply custom distribution functions and arguments to pass to them.

* Document that density functions for custom distributions need "log"
  argument.

* Documented how to supply derivatives of custom distributions for use
  in optimisation.

Output functions:

* New "newdata" argument to summary.flexsurvreg and plot.flexsurvreg
  for an easier way of supplying covariate values.

* User-defined summary functions can be used in summary.flexsurvreg,
  as an alternative to survival, hazard or cumulative hazard.

* New function "normboot.flexsurvreg" to simulate parameters from the
  asymptotic normal distribution of their estimates.  Used for
  representing uncertainty in any function of the parameters.

* summary.flexsurvreg can be called with ci=FALSE to omit confidence
  intervals.

* "start" argument defaults to 0 for all prediction times in
  summary.flexsurvreg. 

* Bug fix in summary.flexsurvreg for left-truncated models, which was
  returning probabilities > 1 before the truncation time.

* New model.frame and model.matrix methods to extract the data from
  fitted flexsurvreg objects.

* Accept vector X in summary.flexsurvreg, and give informative error
  if X in wrong format.  Thanks to Mark Danese.

* Extra arguments can be passed to both muhaz and plot.muhaz in 
  plot.flexsurvreg(...,type="hazard",...)

Printed output: 

* Use format() not signif() for printing flexsurvreg objects, to avoid
  spurious zero significant figures. Thanks to Kenneth Chen.

* Standard errors included in printed output of flexsurvreg, but only
  for parameters optimised on natural or log scales (which includes
  all built-in distributions).

Distribution functions: 

* Bug fix in rgengamma for Q=0 (log-normal) and sigma not equal to 1.

* Don't warn for shape parameters being exactly zero in generalized
  gamma and F, just give NaN.

* basis() and fss() functions for the natural cubic spline basis made
  available to users.


Version 0.3.1 (2014-02-14)
--------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Distribution functions tidied up, making special value handling and
  vectorisation consistent. Hazard and cumulative hazard functions for
  all supported distributions.

* Vectors of different col, lwd and lty can be passed to
  plot.flexsurvreg for multiple fitted lines.  Thanks to Julia
  Sandberg for the report.


Version 0.3 (2014-01-19)
------------------------

* CRAN release. Includes changes from 0.2.1 to 0.2.3.


Version 0.2.3 (2013-10-09)
-------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Parameters other than the location parameter can now have covariates
  on them in flexsurvreg.  Thanks to Milan Bouchet-Valat for help with
  this.

* subset and na.action arguments in flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline.

* coef, vcov and confint methods for all fitted model objects.

* Distribution functions for generalized gamma, generalized F, and
  Gompertz, now allow all parameters to be vectorised.

* Bug fix in analytic derivatives for Weibull.

* Restored print output introduced in 0.1.2 which had been
  accidentally removed in 0.1.5.


Version 0.2.2 (2013-07-26)
-------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Case weights supported in flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline.


Version 0.2.1 (2013-07-03)
-------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Default left truncation times were being set wrongly for
  user-supplied times in summary.flexsurvreg, giving wrong confidence
  intervals.  These now default to 0.

* Confidence intervals set to 1 for t=0 under spline models. Thanks to
  Paul Pynsent.

* dgompertz,dgengamma,dgengamma.orig,dgenf,dgenf.orig fixed to return
  -Inf instead of 0 when density is zero and log=TRUE.  Thanks to Gao
  Zheng.


Version 0.2 (2013-05-13)
-------------------------

* New summary() method for fitted flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline model
  objects gives fitted survival, cumulative hazard or hazard curves,
  with confidence intervals mosly computed by a simulation method.

* This allows plot.flexsurvreg to plot confidence intervals for the
  fitted survival, hazard or cumulative hazard.

* Left-truncated survival observations are supported in flexsurvreg
  and flexsurvspline.

* New psurvspline and dsurvspline functions giving distribution and
  density function for the spline model.

* Analytic derivatives used in optimisation for spline (odds and
  hazard scale, not normal), exponential, Weibull and Gompertz models.

* Default to BFGS optimisation method, which uses derivatives where
  available and should be much faster, instead of Nelder-Mead.

* Work around NaN warnings from spline models presumably due to
  parameters violating implicit constraints.

* If "knots" specified, boundary knots set to min/max of uncensored
  times, not all times, to match results when "k" is specified.
  Thanks to Paul Pynsent.


Version 0.1.5 (2012-08-29)
-------------------------

* Data are now stored in fitted flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline model
  objects, avoiding environment search errors and allowing package
  functions to be called within other functions.  Thanks to Hanna
  Daniel for the report.

* Gompertz documentation clarified for the case when there is a chance
  of living forever.  qgompertz and rgompertz now return Inf in these
  cases, with no warning, instead of NaN.  Thanks to Michael Sweeting.


Version 0.1.4 (2012-03-22)
--------------------------

* maxt argument in plot.flexsurvreg.
